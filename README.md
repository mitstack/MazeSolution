# MazeSolution
- This is an intersting maze to solve. For simplicity sake I am using same number of rows and columns (meaning maze array length is same as number of elements in indiviual array)

# Future Enhancements
Todo : I will be implementing logic to trace upward if all moving forward in X direction and moving down in Y direction is blocked. 
This maze can be of any number of rows and columns (within specified limit to prevent stack overflow and array outofbound exceptions)

# How To Run the code
-install node JS
- clone the repo
- download dependencies (it is using jest for unit testing) CLI - yarn install 
- CLI command : yarn run jest

# unit testing coverage 
- Covered positive scenarios
- Covered negative scenarios (hammer it in several ways :) by proving different number of rows and columns, cause infinite loop, randowm arrays, excercise all 4 paths)
